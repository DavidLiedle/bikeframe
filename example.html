                This is an example file. It represents the current (latest)
                version of eZ Platform, raw and unchanged from the main repo.
                This is specifically the latest <em>tagged</em> version, not the
                master branch's head.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is an example of the SiteAccess topic, in the Certification
                track, for version 1.6.0 of eZ Platform.
